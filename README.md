üìù Python To-Do List GUI Application
A simple and intuitive to-do list application with a graphical user interface, built using the PySimpleGUI library. This project was created to practice file I/O operations and build a functional GUI from scratch, demonstrating an understanding of user-facing applications.

üéØ Project Goal
The main objective was to develop a standalone desktop application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. The application stores tasks in a local file, ensuring persistence even after the program is closed.

‚ú® Key Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks via a text input field.

Mark as Completed: Mark tasks as completed with a single click.

Edit Tasks: Modify the description of an existing task.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.

Data Persistence: All tasks are saved to a todolist.txt file, so your list is preserved between sessions.

User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and clear GUI, making it easy to manage your to-do list.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

PySimpleGUI: A Python library for creating simple and functional GUIs.

os: Python's built-in module for file path and existence checks.

File I/O: Fundamental Python operations for reading from and writing to local files.
